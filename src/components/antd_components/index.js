/* 
    Import the design library component & export it to use in the project
    Make any common change required here. (eg change shape of all buttons to round by just changing here)

    Note:
    - keep props at bottom only (to ensure overwrite)

    eg.

    import { Button as AntButton } from "antd";
    export const Button = (props) => <AntButton shape="round" {...props} />;
